-- Problem 22 - Names scores
--
-- Using "../resources/p022_names.txt", a 46K text file containing over
-- five-thousand first names, begin by sorting it into alphabetical order.
-- Then working out the alphabetical value for each name, multiply this value by
-- its alphabetical position in the list to obtain a name score.
--
-- For example, when the list is sorted into alphabetical order, COLIN, which is
-- worth 3 + 15 + 12 + 9 + 14 = 53, is the 938th name in the list. So, COLIN would
-- obtain a score of 938 Ã— 53 = 49714.
--
-- What is the total of all the name scores in the file?
