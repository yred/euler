// Problem 22 - Names scores
//
// Using "../resources/p022_names.txt", a 46K text file containing over
// five-thousand first names, begin by sorting it into alphabetical order.
// Then working out the alphabetical value for each name, multiply this value by
// its alphabetical position in the list to obtain a name score.
//
// For example, when the list is sorted into alphabetical order, COLIN, which is
// worth 3 + 15 + 12 + 9 + 14 = 53, is the 938th name in the list. So, COLIN would
// obtain a score of 938 Ã— 53 = 49714.
//
// What is the total of all the name scores in the file?
