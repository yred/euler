Euler
=====

These are my solutions to [Project Euler](http://projecteuler.net/) problems. I've chosen to solve each problem in a variety of languages so that I can gain more familiarity with each, and learn to appreciate the sometimes intricate differences between them. 

Although this repo is public, you are encouraged to solve Project Euler problems on your own. Taking a look at a few solutions is certainly possible, though you'll be missing out on most of the fun if you give up and look through other people's solutions too quickly.
