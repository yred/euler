Problem 44 - Pentagon numbers

Pentagonal numbers are generated by the formula, P(n)=n*(3n − 1)/2. The first
ten pentagonal numbers are:

        1, 5, 12, 22, 35, 51, 70, 92, 117, 145, ...

It can be seen that P(4) + P(7) = 22 + 70 = 92 = P(8). However, their
difference, 70 - 22 = 48, is not pentagonal.

Find the pair of pentagonal numbers, P(j) and P(k), for which their sum and
difference are pentagonal and D = |P(k) − P(j)| is minimised. What is the value
of D?
