Problem 106 - Special subset sums: meta-testing

Let S(A) represent the sum of elements in set A of size n. We shall call it a
special sum set if for any two non-empty disjoint subsets, B and C, the
following properties are true:

        S(B) â‰  S(C); that is, sums of subsets cannot be equal.
        If B contains more elements than C then S(B) > S(C).

For this problem we shall assume that a given set contains n strictly
increasing elements and it already satisfies the second rule.

Surprisingly, out of the 25 possible subset pairs that can be obtained from a
set for which n = 4, only 1 of these pairs need to be tested for equality
(first rule). Similarly, when n = 7, only 70 out of the 966 subset pairs need
to be tested.

For n = 12, how many of the 261625 subset pairs that can be obtained need to be
tested for equality?

NOTE: This problem is related to Problem 103 and Problem 105.
