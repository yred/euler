Problem 105 - Special subset sums: testing

Let S(A) represent the sum of elements in set A of size n. We shall call it a
special sum set if for any two non-empty disjoint subsets, B and C, the
following properties are true:

        S(B) â‰  S(C); that is, sums of subsets cannot be equal.
        If B contains more elements than C then S(B) > S(C).

For example, {81, 88, 75, 42, 87, 84, 86, 65} is not a special sum set because

        65 + 87 + 88 = 75 + 81 + 84

whereas {157, 150, 164, 119, 79, 159, 161, 139, 158} satisfies both rules for
all possible subset pair combinations and S(A) = 1286.

Using "../resources/p105_sets.txt", a 4K text file with
one-hundred sets containing seven to twelve elements (the two examples given
above are the first two sets in the file), identify all the special sum sets,
A1, A2, ..., Ak, and find the value of S(A1) + S(A2) + ... + S(Ak).

NOTE: This problem is related to Problem 103 and Problem 106.
