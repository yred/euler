Problem 107 - Minimal network

The following undirected network consists of seven vertices and twelve edges
with a total weight of 243.

        (https://projecteuler.net/project/images/p107_1.gif)

The same network can be represented by the matrix below.

             A    B    C    D    E    F    G
        A    -    16   12   21   -    -    -
        B    16   -    -    17   20   -    -
        C    12   -    -    28   -    31   -
        D    21   17   28   -    18   19   23
        E    -    20   -    18   -    -    11
        F    -    -    31   19   -    -    27
        G    -    -    -    23   11   27   -

However, it is possible to optimise the network by removing some edges and
still ensure that all points on the network remain connected. The network which
achieves the maximum saving is shown below. It has a weight of 93, representing
a saving of 243 âˆ’ 93 = 150 from the original network.

Using "../resources/p107_network.txt", a 6K text file containing a network with
forty vertices, and given in matrix form, find the maximum saving which can be
achieved by removing redundant edges whilst ensuring that the network remains
connected.
