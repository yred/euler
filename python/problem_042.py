Problem 42 - Coded triangle numbers

The n-th term of the sequence of triangle numbers is given by, t(n) = Â½n(n+1);
so the first ten triangle numbers are:

        1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 55, ...

By converting each letter in a word to a number corresponding to its
alphabetical position and adding these values we form a word value. For
example, the word value for SKY is 19 + 11 + 25 = 55 = t(10). If the word value
is a triangle number then we shall call the word a triangle word.

Using "../resources/p042_words.txt", a 16K text file containing nearly
two-thousand common English words, how many are triangle words?
